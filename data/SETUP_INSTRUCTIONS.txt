VAPID Key Setup Instructions
============================

Before running the server, you must generate VAPID keys and place them in this folder.

Steps:
------
1. Visit: https://www.attheminute.com/vapid-key-generator
2. Click "Generate Keys"
3. Copy the PUBLIC KEY and save it to: data/vapid_public.txt
4. Copy the PRIVATE KEY and save it to: data/vapid_private.txt

File Format:
-----------
Each file should contain only the key string, with no extra whitespace or newlines.

Example vapid_public.txt:
BAbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_

Example vapid_private.txt:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMN

Security:
---------
⚠️ NEVER share your private key or commit it to version control!
⚠️ Keep your vapid_private.txt file secure and private.

Once you've created both files, you can start the server with:
  go run .
